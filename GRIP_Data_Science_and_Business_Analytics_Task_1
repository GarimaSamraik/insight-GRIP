#Title- Predicting the Percentage of a student based on the number of hours they study
#Question- What will be the percentage of a student if they study for 9.25 hours a day?
  
#Installing various packages required for this analysis.

#Importing the Hours v/s Scores dataset from source file.
#Let data of students be called data_s.

#Making a scatterplot to show the relationship between Study Hours and Scores of students.
ggplot(data = data_s) + 
      geom_point(mapping = aes(x = Hours, y = Scores), colour = "purple" )) +

#To show the linear relationship between these variables, we use linear regression.
ggplot(data = data_s,
       aes( x = Hours, y = Scores)) + 
  geom_point() + 
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)

#Calculating the coefficients of the data using linear regression.
data_lm_fit <- lm(Scores ~ Hours, data = data_s)
summary(data_lm_fit)
#Coefficient 1 is the intercept and coefficient 2 is the slope.

#Predicting the score.
data_s <- data_s %>% 
  mutate(perc_predictions = fitted(data_lm_fit))
head(data_s)

#Using the equation of linear regression line i.e y = B1 + B2x, we get:
Score <- coef(data_lm_fit)[[1]] + coef(data_lm_fit)[[2]] * 9.25
Score

#The predictive score if a student studies for 9.25c= hours a day is 92.90985.
